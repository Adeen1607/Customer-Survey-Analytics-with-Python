# Customer-Survey-Analytics-with-Python
Loading data from a sample, generated more data by random algorithm and Building Visuals to show Insights on the overall information hidden inside the data. (Note: This is a case study project with real values taken from users to participate in the survey, But due to low responses, data could not be used for analytics and this had to generate it using a python script. I have then proceeded wih the analytics part in a seperate notebook)
